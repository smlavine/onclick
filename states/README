A state machine that matches the ANSI terminal escape sequence that signals
a "mouse up" input. Matches the regex

	"\x1B\\[<0;[0-9]+;[0-9]+M".

Using the standard regex engine would be difficult for this situation
because input must be unbuffered, and the standard engine does not allow
for "partial matches".

Consider the following pseudo-example:

        for (let machine = &start; have_input() && machine != &end) {
        	machine = machine(input());
        	// ...
        };
